# Data Max Internship Assignment

Given two arrays (`array_a` and `array_b`) with integer numbers, write a function that returns an array containing all elements in both arrays without duplicates.

## Examples:

#### Example 1:
* `array_a = [1, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 65, 9, 7]`
* `array_b = [5, 6, 43, 8, 39, 74, 9, 100]`
* `Expected output should contain: [1, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 65, 9, 7, 5, 6, 43, 39, 74]`

#### Example 2:
* `array_a = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
* `array_b = [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50]`
* `Expected output should contain: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50]`

#### Example 3:
* `array_a = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
* `array_b = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]`
* `Expected output should contain: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

#### Example 4:
* `array_a = []`
* `array_b = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]`
* `Expected output should contain: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]`

## Requirements:
- Use only arrays as data structures. Sets, trees or maps are not allowed.
- Ordering of elements in the returned array is *not* important.
- There are no duplicated elements in either arrays.
- Aim for an optimal solution.
- Please include in your solution a separate file explaining the complexity (Big-O notation) of your solution.
